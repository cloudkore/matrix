            <p>NinjaBase offers a suite of integrated tools to help you organize and protect your sensitive information:</p>

            <h3>Secure Notes</h3>
            <p>You can securely save and retrieve your personal notes within NinjaBase. All notes are encrypted using advanced cryptographic methods before being stored, ensuring that your private thoughts and information remain confidential and accessible only by you.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Security at its Core</h2>
            <p>NinjaBase is built with a strong emphasis on security, ensuring your data is protected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Master Password Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data, including your notes and passwords, are encrypted using a strong master password that you set. This master password derives a unique encryption key using <strong>PBKDF2 with 200,000 iterations and SHA256 hashing</strong>, a highly secure key derivation function, ensuring your data is exceptionally well-protected. This key is session-based, meaning it's only active while you're logged in and interacting with your encrypted data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Your data is stored securely, and access to sensitive features like notes, password manager, and file storage requires verification with your master password.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> User accounts and profile information (username and avatar) are managed through a robust authentication system.</li>
            </ul>
