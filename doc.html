        <p>Welcome to the Matrix™ Dashboard, your personal, secure space built with privacy and convenience in mind. Inspired by the tactical world of Ninja School Online, our dashboard provides essential tools to manage your digital life with robust security measures.</p>

        <h3>What is the Matrix™ Dashboard?</h3>
        <p>The Matrix™ Dashboard is the central hub of your Matrix™ web application. It's designed to give you easy access to critical personal tools like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Notes:</strong> Store important thoughts, reminders, or game strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Password Manager:</strong> Safely keep track of your login credentials for various services.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephemeral Files Storage:</strong> Upload and manage temporary files securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Management:</strong> Customize your in-app identity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Data, Your Security: Encryption Explained</h3>
        <p>At the core of the Matrix™ Dashboard's security is <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>. This means your sensitive data (notes, passwords, and files) is scrambled and made unreadable *before* it ever leaves your device and is stored on our servers.</p>
        <p>Here's how we ensure your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Master Password:</strong> When you first set up your account or access sensitive features, you'll be prompted to create or enter a "Master Password." This password is never stored on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Derivation:</strong> Your Master Password is used to derive a unique <strong>encryption key</strong> on your device using a strong, industry-standard algorithm called <strong>PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)</strong> with 200,000 iterations and SHA256 hashing. This process ensures that even if our databases were compromised, your Master Password cannot be reverse-engineered, and your data remains unreadable.</li>
            <li><strong>Session-Based Key:</strong> For your convenience and continued security, this derived encryption key is stored temporarily in your browser's <code>sessionStorage</code>. This allows you to access your encrypted data throughout your current session without re-entering your Master Password for every action. However, once you log out or close your browser, this session key is automatically cleared.</li>
            <li><strong>No Server Access:</strong> Because your data is encrypted on your device using a key *only you know*, <strong>no one else, not even the Matrix™ administrators or developers, can access or read your sensitive notes, passwords, or files.</strong> This provides a strong guarantee of privacy and confidentiality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Due to this robust encryption method, if you forget your Master Password, <strong>there is no way to reset it or recover your encrypted data.</strong> We recommend storing your Master Password in a safe, offline location.</p>

        <h3>Dashboard Features</h3>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Underlying Technologies</h3>
        <p>The Matrix™ application leverages powerful and secure cloud technologies to provide its services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for user authentication (managing your login and user sessions) and for storing your encrypted notes and password manager entries in its Firestore database. Your user profile data (username, avatar, encryption salt, and master password hash) is also stored here.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Utilized for secure and ephemeral file storage. File uploads, listings, and deletions are handled via Supabase Edge Functions for efficient and secure operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptographic Libraries (CryptoJS):</strong> Powers the robust encryption and decryption of your sensitive data using AES encryption and PBKDF2 for key derivation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accessibility and Cross-Platform Compatibility</h3>
        <p>Matrix™ is designed as a web application, making it accessible across a variety of platforms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> You can access the Matrix™ Dashboard seamlessly on <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong> desktop operating systems using any modern web browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> The web application is designed to be responsive, providing a good user experience on mobile devices, including <strong>Android</strong> smartphones and tablets.</li>
